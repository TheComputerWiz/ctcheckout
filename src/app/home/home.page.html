		YOUR CUSTOMER’S CT CHECKOUT APP KEEPS THEIR CARD DATA OFF THE INTERNET
		<br><br>
		<b>You never see your customer’s encrypted prepaid debit card data</b>
		<br><br><b>Your customers prepaid debit cards are encrypted by Triple DES and Derived Unique Key Per Transaction.</b>
		<br><br><b>Your customers simply load value onto their encrypted prepaid debit cards to take advantage of the incentive discounts you offer them to pay you with their encrypted prepaid debit card</b>
		<br><br><b>You have zero chance of losing a friendly fraud dispute when paid by an encrypted prepaid debit card.</b>

		Until now it has been the disputer’s statement “that I don’t recognize this transaction” that pulls your money from your merchant account while the dispute is investigated by the card issuer.
		NOW, the card issuer will ask the disputer how someone had the disputer’s iPhone or Android phone and was able to open the disputer’s iPhone or Android phone and then knew the log in to the disputer’s CT Checkout app.
		NOW, you have a terminal, called an iPhone or Android phone, between the disputer and you that made the CT Checkout encrypted card payment. The friendly fraud dispute is quickly settled in your favor.
		A CT Checkout transaction can start on a desktop but it is always completed on the user’s Android or iPhone.
